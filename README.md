# Fertility_LLCM
This is where I store all the necessary data and codes for my research "An Investigation of Fertility Decision Making through the Labour-Leisure Choice Model".
The paper could be read at "https://www.kygmin.com/working-papers/an-investigation-of-fertility-decision-making-through-llcm"

## Codes
The folder includes a code that is run via matlab. The code includes FE Modeling and visualisation of the data. 

## Data
This folder includes all the data I have used in my research. "R.csv" includes correlation coefficient value, which the code to calculate such value is not avaiable in the matlab code. 

## graphs
The visualisations I gained from the matlab codes are all included in the file. "Fertility Rate Over Years" is coded using python, but the matlab code is available in the codes folder. 

## results
The FE results are available in graphics. 

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to professor So Kubota, who gave me feedbacks throughout my research. The report was written for his "Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Approach to Macroeconomics" course at Waseda University.
